
*** CONCEPT (CHECK/DIGETS):
- !(add) Configurable: fake a lower number of players on list-ping [WAITING FOR FEATURE REQUEST]
? add configurability and on demand event registrations (by config !)
? add cancelling of more interaction !
? use entity ids for fastest checking ?
?extenda
? vanish configs (determine what is vanished and what not what damage/interaction)
? vanishcfg: certian perm to see a player.
? check update for efficiency
? camera vanish
? dynamic command registration (also for vanishcfgs)


- ?(add) prevent chat toggle 
? maybe refactor: use some settings object to detach the config from core completely.

(0.3.0)
