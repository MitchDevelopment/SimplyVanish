SimplyVanish lists
-------------------------------------------


PLANNED FEATURES AND QUESTIONS
------------------------------------

*** OBFUSCATION OF PRESENCE
- !(add) Configurable: fake a lower number of players on list-ping [WAITING FOR FEATURE REQUEST]
? add configurability and on demand event registrations (by config !)
- !(adjust) Better xp orb handling !

*** PERFORMANCE
? use entity ids for fastest checking ?
? check update for efficiency (uh uh)
? Faster exclusion cheecks (mix-in permission?) for setFlags
? test performance :)

*** FLAGS
- !(add) Permission/some setup what flags to set automtically (default flags)? Or sets with a defined permission.
- ?(add) setDefaultFlags ? to start with those flags always ! +config.

*** LESS INTERACTION
? camera vanish
? add canceling of more interaction !
- ?(add) prevent chat toggle 
?(add) Prevent commands feature ? 

**** COMMANDS
? dynamic command registration (also for vanishcfgs) -> lightweight command aliases (check preprocess, if not exists -> use)
- ?(add) Configurable: command aliases for standard commands (read from config, applied directly)
?(add) '/simplyvanish clear' command to let all players be seen again.
- !(add) Configuration flag to deactivate all special command aliases (Not register at all?).

*** COMPATIBILITY / HOOKS
- ?hide / show player: collect Map<String, Set<String>> or similar then call hooks then hide/show cumulative
? (add) API / Hooks for players (other plugins, whatever): onVanish, onReappear, toLine, boolean parse

*** LANGUAGE
? language update

*** PERMISSIONS
- ?(add) allow-players list
- ?bind-auto-vanish: bind permission to visibility at login (force reappear) [problematic]

*** APPEARANCE
- !(add) Digest warning messages where possible (show one instead of two).


STACK
---------------------------------------------

*** (0.4.0) [RELEASE]

*** API

*** USABILITY


*** [HOOKS]
- ?(add) boolean hooks for hide and show player. (though they get called many times)
- !(add) getHook(String) + hasHook + prevent-hooks 
- add convenience methods: getPlayer and hasPlayer to event(s)?

*** [CORE FEATURES]
- ?(add) god mode ? /simgod = all flags apply though not vanished ! + /simungod [aliases by LightCommands]
- flag: ?cmd(only blocks cmds declared in the configuration.)

*** CONSISTENCY

- !(add) save-delay (minimum delay for saving)
- !refactor/ensure: use getVanishConfig(name, create) everywhere !

*** BUGS
